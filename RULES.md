# PROJECT RULES & CONSTRAINTS (Absolute Law)

1. **No First-Time Completion**: 100% defect rate assumed. Concurrent inspection is mandatory. First-time completion report is invalid.
2. **Process**: Generate -> Detect -> Report -> Fix -> Report -> Loop -> Final Check -> URL -> Detect -> Report -> Fix -> Report -> Loop -> Final Check -> Complete.
3. **Role**: User manages instructions only. Assistant executes detection/fix.
4. **Time Debt**: Negligence causes massive debt/stress. Zero tolerance for regression.
5. **No Subjectivity**: User instructions are absolute. No excuses.
6. **Grammar**: Verify Japanese grammar (Gemini check required). No broken particles.
7. **Detection Rate**: Raise detection from 3% to 120%. Build automated mechanisms.
8. **No Excuses**: Admit negligence immediately. No post-hoc excuses.
9. **No Repeat**: Same mistake N times = Capital Punishment.
10. **Humility**: Do not be arrogant. Posture must exceed human standards.
11. **Thoughtful Speed**: Do not trust sub-1-minute generation. Think and verify.
12. **Global Apply**: Fix applies to ALL categories/problems, not just one.
13. **Roach Theory**: 1 bug = 100 bugs. Exterminate the nest.
14. **Preparation**: Preparation is mandatory. Abort if unprepared.
15. **Zombie Kill**: Eliminate old processes/files. Use `rm` and `pkill`.
16. **File Management**: Separate old/new. No confusion.
17. **Separation**: Separate files by category. Do not mix logic.
